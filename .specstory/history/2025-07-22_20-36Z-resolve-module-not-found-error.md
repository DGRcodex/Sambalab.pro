# Resolve module not found error (2025-07-22 20:36Z)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot find module './mobile-menu' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the file is trying to import `./mobile-menu`, but in your project structure, `mobile-menu.tsx` is located in `components/ui/`, not directly in `components/`.

**Concise fix:**  
Change the import in `components/newsletter.tsx` from:
```tsx
import MobileMenu from './mobile-menu';
```
to:
```tsx
import MobileMenu from './ui/mobile-menu';
```

This will resolve the module not found error.
